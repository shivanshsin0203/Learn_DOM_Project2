# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project

Welcome to this repository! This project showcases the power and flexibility of JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation capabilities.

- **Event Handling**: Attaching event listeners to elements to respond to user actions.
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Programmatically creating and injecting new elements into the DOM.
